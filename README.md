# Hi!
# Welcome to my portfolio site
This is nothing more than a simple site for introductions, and a holding place for various side projects and small work samples.

Created using [create-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte), and following [tutorial provided by FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2UjwQzxvBQ).

## TODO:
* Add testing via Playwright -- structure is already present, but nothinig hooked up
* Deploy to Github pages (maybe?)
* Work on formatting/linting rules and figure out why VSCode reports errors when nothing's wrong. Likely due to issues between JS/TS
------
## Developing
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building
To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Run formatting
```
npm run format
```
